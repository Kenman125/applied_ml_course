# Midterm topics

## Machine Learning Disciplines

1. Supervised Learning.
2. Unsupervised Learning.
3. Reinforcment Learning.

Be able to distiguish between the three tasks in machine learning. In particular, understand the framing of the supervised learning problem including the learning task, the role of the loss function, and the choice of function space.

## Python

1. Basics: types, functions, and control structures.
2. Dealing with data: numpy and pandas.
3. Supervised learning: sklearn, pipelines, columntransformers.

You will not be asked to write any code on the test, but you will be asked to identify what code is doing and what objects it produces.

## Classification modeling

1. Model types.
	1. Logistic regression.
	2. Random forests.
	3. Gradient boosting classifiers.
2. Data preprocessing.
3. Model Evaluation.
	1. Train test split.
	2. Cross validation.
	3. ROC Curves.
	4. Confusion matrices.
4. The bias variance tradeoff.
	1. Boosting.
	2. Bagging.
	3. Generalization error, overfitting, and underfitting.
	4. Hyperparameter tuning.

## Regression modeling

1. Model types.
	1. Linear regression.
	2. Random forests.
	3. Gradient boosting regressors.
2. Model evaluation.
	1. RMSE.
	2. R squared.
